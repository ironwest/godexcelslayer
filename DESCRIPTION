Description: Excel files are sometimes used as replacement of paper. Such excel files are terribly hard to convert in the form for R.
    Those excel files are sometimes referred to as "Paper-Excel" or "Kami Excel" in Japan. Paper in Japanese is "Kami". Also, paper and god are homonym in Japanese.
    This package godexcelslayer aims to slay those "Kami-Excel"s and provide relief to any data related tasks using "Kami-Excel"s.
